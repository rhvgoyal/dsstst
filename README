Those tests are designed to be run in ether CI openstack or standalone mode to
test docker-storage-setup command. It will use virt-install for standalone setup.
The test cases are listed below. Some tests will have separate setup steps to
be executed first.

1. DEVS without VG (also to use root disk's extra space). It requires that the
   root disk is in a VG. Additional setup is required. The root disk's VG
   will be backed by the DEVS and docker pool will be in the VG.

2. VG (does not exist and with DEVS). It will create the VG using root disk's
   free space. Additiona setup is required for a additional disk.

3. VG exist (same one for root disk) and with DEVS. Additional setup is
   required. Docker pool will use the VG backed by DEVS.

4. Set GROWPART=true and ROOT_SIZE=<bigger than current root size>: additional
   setup is required to increase the root disk's backing device size. The
   partition table should be resized afterwards. Addtional setup is required
   to increase the root disk's backing device size, and there is no auto-grow
   of the partition by default.

5. Check docker pool data size uses 60% of the free space available by default
   and set AUTO_EXTEND_POOL=no to prevent pool extenstion happenning
   automatically when the it is full.

6. Set POOL_AUTOEXTEND_THRESHOLD=70 and POOL_AUTOEXTEND_PERCENT=30. Once the
   docker pool reaches the threshold, the pool will be extended by 30% of the
   existing pool size.

7. Set DATA_SIZE=80% and check the chunk_size=512 and data volume size is
   indeed 80%.

8. Set DATA_SIZE=<size equal to around 70% free space> and CHUNK_SIZE=1024,
   and then verify them.

9. Set overlayfs as the graph driver for docker.
